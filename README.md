## App Framework

Celo Terminal is not just a wallet. Celo Terminal is an extensible platform to build easy to use and secure DApp UIs to
simplify the development for the builders and to improve usability for the users. If you are building smart contract
based protocols or systems on top of the Celo platform, checkout how you can build your UI on top of Celo Terminal
[here](./docs/building-apps.md).

## Security & Privacy

Celo Terminal is built from the start with emphasis on security and privacy. At its core, Celo Terminal only interacts
with the blockchain node. It doesn't collect any analytics, and it doesn't even send out any debug logs. While Celo Terminal
provides support for built-in software upgrades, it never installs those upgrades without explicit user action.

Some of the non-core DApps might require interacting with external servers other than the blockchain node, but
those interactions should only happen when DApp is in active use. As Celo Terminal evolves, it will provide clearer
guidelines and indicators when any of the DApps interact to external servers, so users can always stay informed and
in full control.
